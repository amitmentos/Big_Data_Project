- **Realistic Delay Patterns**: 
  - 40% immediate (< 1 hour)
  - 30% short delay (1-6 hours) 
  - 20% medium delay (6-24 hours)
  - 10% long delay (24-48 hours)

### 2. **Smart Streaming Consumer**

- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed tracking of delayed sales with severity levels
- **Demo Awareness**: Special handling for demo metadata and late arrival batches
- **Statistical Tracking**: Comprehensive delay statistics and breakdowns

### 3. **Kafka Delay Monitor**
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Dedicated service to monitor delay patterns
- **Category Classification**: Automatic categorization of delays (immediate, short, medium, long, critical)
- **Alert System**: Alerts for high-delay events (> 6 hours)
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Periodic statistics reporting every 30 seconds

### 4. **Updated Demo Script**
- **Current Date Data Generation**: Modified to generate data with current timestamps (June 17, 2025)
- **Delay Flow Integration**: Integrated delay demonstration into main platform demo
- **Enhanced Data Patterns**: Realistic data with varied delay patterns for demonstration

## **How the Delay Data Flow Works**

### **Step 1: Data Generation with Delays**
```bash
# Start delay demo mode producer
docker compose exec kafka-producers env DELAY_DEMO_MODE=true SALES_PER_HOUR=200 python marketplace_sales_producer.py
```

### **Step 2: Real-time Processing**
```bash
# Start enhanced streaming consumer
docker compose exec spark-master python /opt/spark-apps/streaming_consumer.py
```

### **Step 3: Delay Monitoring**
```bash
# Start delay monitor
docker compose exec spark-master python /opt/spark-apps/kafka_delay_monitor.py
```

### **Step 4: Late Arrival Batch Simulation**
```bash
# Trigger late arrival batch
docker compose exec kafka-producers env LATE_ARRIVAL_BATCH=true BATCH_SIZE=20 python marketplace_sales_producer.py --late-batch
```

## **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Marketplace Sales Producer Enhancements**
```python
def run_delay_demo_mode(self, sales_per_hour: int, duration_minutes: int = None):
    # Enhanced delay patterns for demonstration
    delay_patterns = {
        'immediate': 0,      # 40% immediate
        'short_delay': lambda: random.randint(1, 6),     # 30% 1-6 hours
        'medium_delay': lambda: random.randint(6, 24),   # 20% 6-24 hours  
        'long_delay': lambda: random.randint(24, 48)     # 10% 24-48 hours
    }
```

### **Delay Analysis in Consumer**
```python
def calculate_delay_metrics(self, sale: Dict) -> Dict:
    delay_timedelta = ingestion_time - transaction_time
    delay_hours = delay_timedelta.total_seconds() / 3600
    
    # Determine delay severity
    if delay_hours < 1: delay_severity = "immediate"
    elif delay_hours < 6: delay_severity = "short"
    elif delay_hours < 24: delay_severity = "medium"
    elif delay_hours < 48: delay_severity = "long"
    else: delay_severity = "critical"
```

### **Real-time Monitoring**
```python
# Kafka Delay Monitor with real-time alerting
if delay_info['delay_hours'] > 6:
    logger.warning(f"HIGH DELAY DETECTED: {sale['transaction_id']} | "
                   f"Delay: {delay_info['delay_hours']:.2f}h | "
                   f"Category: {delay_info['delay_category']}")
```
